- Cervical cancer is a problem that affects millions of people globally
- The only procedure that can confirm this disease is a biopsy
- This requires medical expertise and sound infrastructure that may not be available in rural and developing areas
- Machine learning models can be used in those areas to help screen potential patients
- We used data of 858 patients collected in a Hospital in Venezuela to train machine learning models to detect cancer without a biopsy
---
### 4 Models were trained to predict biopsy results of patients:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree with bagging
- Random Forest Algorithm
- XGBoost
